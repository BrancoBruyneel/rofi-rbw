# rbw-rofi
## A rofi frontend for Bitwarden

Based on the alternative [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) CLI [rbw](https://git.tozt.net/rbw) and inspired by [rofi-pass](https://github.com/carnager/rofi-pass), `rbw-rofi` is a simplistic password typer/copier using [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi).

## Features
- Type the selected password with `Enter` or `Alt+3`
- Type the selected username with `Alt+2`
- Autotype username and password (with a `tab` character in between) with `Alt+1`
- Copy the username to your clipboard with `Alt+u`
- Copy the password to your clipboard with `Alt+p`

## Installation
### Manual
For now, all you need to do is copy the file `rofi_rbw/rofi_rbw.py` into your path and call it.
